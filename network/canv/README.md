# CANV: Co-Authorship Network Visualization

![Example](asset/teaser.png)

CANV is an interactive co-authorship network visualization tool (a.k.a. collaboration graph) based on [webweb](https://github.com/dblarremore/webweb). See an example above (my network). You can use this tool to create a standalone webpage containing your co-authorship network. 

## Note

I wrote and revised several files to modify this original repository to fit my needs. The original repository can be found [here](https://github.com/Xovee/canv).

The canv.py is modified so that the author information retrieved by the semantic scholar api can be parsed into the generating process. The batch_gen.py can generate all the *.csv files in the data folder.
