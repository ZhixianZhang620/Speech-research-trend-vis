The co-occurrence network was created using SigmaJS and Gephi. To streamline the network, only authors with papers in the top 100 citation count were included.

- Each node represents an author, with the size of the node reflecting its weighted degree.
- The color of each node corresponds to its weighted degree.
- Edges represent co-occurrence relationships between two authors.
